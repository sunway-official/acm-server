      Dear ${user.position} ${user.firstname},
      <br>
      <br>
      I am writing this email to thanks for your submission to [Conferenceâ€™s acronym name]. However, we regret to inform you that your paper could not be accepted for presentation after being reviewed since the justification: [the detail reason of Rejection | Comment of Reivewer].
      <br>
      <br>
      But we would suggest that you modify your paper with the requirements of the conference very well, and welcome to submit for Round 2 before ${
        conference.dl_re_submit_paper
      }.
      <br>
      <br>
      We look forward to hearing from you soon and please feel free to contact us if we can be of further assistance.
      <br>
      Sincerely,
    </body>
    </html>
