There were 3 million Syrian refugees in 2014; now there are 4.9 million. Inside this overwhelming crisis are the individual human stories -- of care, growth and family, in the face of lost education, lost home, lost future.

In this insightful talk, he offers four ways to change the way we treat refugees, so they can make an immediate contribution to their new homes. \\"There\'s nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost,\\" Betts says. \\"They\'re human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them.\\"',
